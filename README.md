## AntiZon, a price checker for Amazon.
AntiZon is a simple utility to give consumers the ability to ensure they are getting the right price for what they are buying. Amazon is known to being generally more expensive (especially with third-party sellers) because of the fees Amazon induces.

## How does it work?
AntiZon uses [Rainforest](https://rainforestapi.com) to scrape data from Amazon, then searches google using [Serpapi](https://serpapi.com) to get google shopping information. Then, AntiZon will automatically cross check prices and present the end user with a list of URLS with prices & providers to choose from.

## Flaws
* AntiZon relies on third-party "freemium" services to function. (I plan to definitely change this in the future)
* AntiZon processes information lazily (I plan to change this very soon)
AntiZon is lazy because this was just a fun project, however, if it picks up steam, I will put more effort into the project.

## How-to
1. Signup for [Rainforest](https://rainforestapi.com) & [Serpapi](https://serpapi.com)
2. Have your API keys (for both services) ready to use.
3. Download the latest release of AntiZon
4. Unpack the zip
5. Run "AntiZon.exe"
6. Get the "ASIN" from the URL (amazon.com/*product-name*/dp/**ASIN-IS-HERE**/)
7. Follow instructions inside executable.
